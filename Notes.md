# TODO

- (optional) Add a ``rules --edit`` command : Reload tracked elements and edit them like after a scan
- New scans should only show differences with previous scans
- Actual code is mostly "source repository" specific, it should be more isolated
- Create a "backup repository"
- Create dedicated "backup repository" rules
